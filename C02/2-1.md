### a.
Insertion sort can sort list of length k in $\theta(k^2)$ worst-case time. So for n/k lists, the time is $\theta(nk)$.
### b.
The height of the tree formed by n/k sublists is $\theta(log(n/k))$. And each level's merging is $\theta(n)$. So the worst-case time is $\theta(nlog(n/k))$.
### c.
$\theta(nk+nlg(n/k))$should be equal to $\theta(nlgn)$
So k cannot grow faster than lgn. The largest value of k=lgn.
### d.
Insertion Sort:$\theta(c_1n^2)$
Merge Sort:$\theta(c_2nlgn)$
$$c_1k^2<=c_2klgk$$
$$k<=(c_2/c_1)lgk$$
